# Aviation-Simulation
It is an Operating System project. Created for just learning purposes. Following are tow main objectives of this project:
1. Learning "Priority Scheduling"
2. Learning C# language

### Description
Air Traffic control (ATC) is one of the main part in any airport. ATC is responsible for coordinating the landing and take off of various planes. This ensures that no accident will happen and passengers can travel safe and sound.
If there are more than one plane that is asking of landing, then ATC should check which plane should be landed first based on various factors like:

- Remaining fuel
- Any emergency inside plane
- Number of passengers etc



This is a classical example of **Priority Scheduling**, each plane will be given a priority on various factors and pane having maximum priority will be allowed land.

## Program Demo
When you run the program this screen will appear:

Now as you can see incoming planes list is empty. There are two ways in which you can create a new plane ready for landing.

1. Fill in the values and click "Insert"
2. Click "Generate", this will fill all the values automatically and then you can click "Insert".

This is how the program looks while running.
